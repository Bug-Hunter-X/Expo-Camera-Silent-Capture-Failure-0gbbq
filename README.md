# Expo Camera Silent Capture Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where image/video capture fails silently within a custom component. The camera preview renders correctly, yet capture attempts produce no output and trigger no errors. This is a common issue stemming from permissions, missing event handlers, or incorrect asynchronous handling. The solution involves carefully checking permissions, ensuring all necessary event handlers are implemented, and managing asynchronous operations with `async/await`.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  Follow these steps to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or your preferred Expo development environment.
4. Attempt to capture an image or video. Observe that no capture takes place without any console error messages.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code. The key changes include explicit permission handling and thorough asynchronous operation management.
